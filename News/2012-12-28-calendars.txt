Calendar support

Pages in the **Events** and **Curriculm** sections of the website
now carry calendar links (look for an icon decorated with a drop-shadow effect).
Clicking on one of these links will automatically add the electronic
diary included in most modern computers and mobile devices.

For the convenience of overseas site visitors, calendar dates and
times are set in universal time, and will adjust to the visitor's
own timezone.

We hope that this new facility will make participating in the
life of the faculty that much easier for staff, students, and
both virtual and on-campus visitors.
