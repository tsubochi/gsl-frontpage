We have a new look!

Yesterday the GSL website presented the same face to the world that it
has done for the past five years. The site has served our community
faithfully, and continues to carry essential information about our
programs and our faculty. Changes are brewing, however, with the
deployment of new programs and the enrichment of our faculty with new
members from the four corners of the world.

More news on events will emerge in the coming weeks and months, but to
prepare the ground, we have given the site a touch of modern
design. We hope you like the new theme, and we look forward to an
enhanced role for the site in the developing life of the faculty and
its community.
