Site reorganization

To provide information on new programs, new staff, and new curriculum,
we have reorganized the links in the **Programs**, **Curriculum** and
**Staff** areas of the website. We hope that the new layout will make
it easier for visitors to locate information on our programs.
Feel free to comment on these and other upcoming changes to the site
via the comment link at the bottom of each page -- we are always open
to suggestions for improvement.
