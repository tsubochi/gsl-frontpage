News updates

Visitors to the GSL website over the
past several years will have noticed that the news
items on our front page have not always been, shall
we say, *new*.

This is about to change, thanks to new lightweight
procedures that will help us capture events as they
are announced on the University's internal mailing lists.
Frequent visitors may find it convenient to follow
announcements using the news feed link prominently
displayed on the top page of the site.
