Dr. See studied competition law at the Graduate School for International
Development, obtaining the degree of Ph.D. in 2009. Upon his return to Malaysia, he was invited by the
Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives & Consumerism (MDTCC) to
advise the Implementation of Competition Law Committee of the Interim
Competition Commission of Malaysia. He was also commissioned by the
newly established Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC) to prepare the first
draft of competition law handbooks for the general public, business
community, and public sector. He launched the first ever Competition Law
course offered in Malaysia since the passing of the Competition Act
2010, which entered into force January 2012.
